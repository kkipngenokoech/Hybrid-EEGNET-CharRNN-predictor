# IMPROVING SSVEP SPELLERS WITH DATA AUGUMENTATION AND LANGUAGE MODELS

## INTRODUCTION

In this project, we focused on leveraging language models to complement SSVEP spellers by predicting the next word, enhancing contextual accuracy, and improving the overall communication experience in brain-computer interface systems.

SSVEP spellers are brain-computer interface (BCI) systems that enable users to type by focusing on flickering stimuli on a screen, with each stimulus associated with a unique frequency detected through EEG signals. These systems translate brain responses into commands or text, providing a communication tool for individuals with severe motor impairments.
